# ConsoleOS
ConsoleOS is a approach to create a Console based OS. It runs in the command line with diffrent types of commands to do various stuff, like a text editor, or a calculator or even a "browser"(This uses pywebview so you need to have a browser of some sort installed. sorry to dissapoint you...)
